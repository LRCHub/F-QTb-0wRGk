[00:24.89] You think the birds are pretty
[00:27.63] And you sleep eight hours a night.
[00:30.87] And I'm fog, out of the city,
[00:33.66] And still you stake it all.
[00:36.45] And trains stop for you and so do the boys,
[00:39.23] When you run your fingers through your hair.
[00:42.05] But resistance is futile.
[00:54.55] 
[00:48.74] And I am gonna drink your blood
[00:54.30] And I am gonna drink your blood
[01:00.56] And I am gonna drink your blood
[01:06.27] And I am gonna drink your blood
[01:21.77] 
[01:36.61] Just breathe, and mouth "goodbye."
[01:40.08] If you want, I'll give you eternal life.
[01:48.35] Well, not so much life,
[01:50.11] But have you ever seen a good zombie movie?
[01:54.53] Well, like that, but you'll be smarter
[01:57.31] And you'll stay twenty-three.
[02:11.81] 
[02:00.37] And I am gonna drink your blood
[02:06.29] And I just wanna drink your blood
[02:12.50] And I am gonna drink your blood
[02:18.19] And I just wanna drink your blood
[02:34.69] 
[02:48.62] And I am gonna drink your blood
[02:54.23] And I am gonna drink your blood
[03:00.08] And I am gonna drink your blood
[03:06.15] And I am gonna drink your blood
